title: Redirects and Flow Completion
---

Ory Cloud offers a few methods to integrate your own user interface (UI) such as utilising the SDK in Single Page Applications
(ReactJs, Angular, VueJs etc.) or using redirects in Server Side Applications (NodeJs, PHP, Golang etc.).

On this page of the documentation we will be covering Browser Redirects and how to configure it on the Ory Cloud console
if you are interested in utilising the SDK for Single Page Applications, check out our [SDK](./services-api.mdx) documentation.

For a deeper dive into the background of this setup, head over to our open source documentation:

## Redirect Flows

The Ory Cloud has a total of 6 flows, Login, Registration, Verification, Recovery, Settings and Logout which can be configured
to redirect back to any url you specify. As an example you can redirect the user to your application home screen after a logout
or to a specific url on a sub-domain for settings. On project creation the redirect flows are all set to the default
Ory Cloud Managed UI.

### Login and Registration

The Login flow has three fields (all optional):
1. `Default Redirect Url` domain or path
2. An `After Password Redirect Url`
3. An `After OIDC Redirect Url` (**currently not supported**)

When setting the `Default Redirect Url` as a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) such as e.g. https://domain.example/login
it will overwrite the `Global Redirect Url`. As a path it will replace the `Global Redirect Url` path, e.g. a path such as
`/login` will alter https://somedomain.example/global/path to https://somedomain.example/login.

On the sub-conditions such as `After Password` or `After OIDC` an FQDN can also be set or a path.
In the case of a FQDN it will replace the closest relative starting with the Login/Registration `Default Redirect Url`
and then the `Global Redirect Url`.

### Settings

The Settings flow has three fields (all optional):
1. `Default Redirect Url` domain or path
2. An `After Password Redirect Url`
3. An `After Profile Redirect Url`

### Verification, Recovery and Logout

Each of these flows have only a single field, the `Default Redirect Url`.
