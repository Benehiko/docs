title: Managed User Interface
---

Ory Cloud provides a managed user interface (UI) by default per Ory Project. The
Managed UI gives users the ability to quickly integrate with the Ory Cloud with
minimal setup, but also provides all of the Ory Cloud's features through the
Managed UI (such as [Identity Schema Customization](./identity.mdx)).

Setting up the Managed UI does not require much configuration as it is enabled
by default. The only configurations which would require some setup would be
redirecting the user back to your application. For more information on how to
configure Browser Redirects, please visit the
[Redirects and Flow Completion](./redirects.mdx) page.

The projects' Managed UI can be tested using the "Launch Managed UI" option on
the Console sidebar.

The Welcome screen allows for easy navigation and testing of the Managed UI's
features.

:::info

The Managed UI is dynamic which means enabling certain features (such as
Two-Factor Authentication) or customising the [Identity Schema](./identity.mdx)
will update your Ory project's Managed UI.
